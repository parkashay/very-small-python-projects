## Small projects for learning python

### Requirements:

- python 3
- pipenv (for installing packages in a virtual environment. If the packages are already installed globally, then no need to install.)

### How to run:

    cd into a project and just run the main.py file.
    example:
        ```bash
            cd quiz
            python main.py
        ```
